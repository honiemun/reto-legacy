## ‚ö†Ô∏è Long-term Support

Starting **March 1st, 2022**, Reto (now Reto Legacy) will enter Long-Term Support, meaning no major updates aside from bug fixes will be launched. You can continue using Reto Legacy until **March 2023**, in which it'll reach End of Life and will no longer be in active development. Thank you for your support over the years!

Reto isn't going anywhere, however - a version of Reto built from the ground up, code-named Retool, is in development - with an ETA of April 2022. The hosted version of Reto (which you can invite over to your server without installing anything) will migrate to this new version around this date.

## ü§ñ Reto
> Reto is a community-oriented Discord bot, featuring a karma system, a way to reward the best comments, leaderboards, and so much more! React to a post with the `plus` or `minus` emojis to give said user some points for their content. `Curators` can even star (react with the exclusive `10` emoji) posts to give them extra points, and add their comment to a special "Best Of" channel for all to admire!
