## ‚ùå End-of-Life

Reto Legacy's codebase has been discontinued on **April 6th, 2023**, after entering LTS in **March 1st, 2022**. The current open-source code is given as-is, without any planned updates or bug-fixes. Thank you so much for supporting Reto over the years!

The current version of Reto Legacy (1.8) is currently being hosted on [Discord](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=591466921812164608&permissions=1342524496&scope=bot) until its successor, Retool (closed-source, at the moment), has finished development - keep in mind the current version may encounter performance issues due to the amount of servers it has to keep going at a time.

## ü§ñ Reto
> Reto is a community-oriented Discord bot, featuring a karma system, a way to reward the best comments, leaderboards, and so much more! React to a post with the `plus` or `minus` emojis to give said user some points for their content. `Curators` can even star (react with the exclusive `10` emoji) posts to give them extra points, and add their comment to a special "Best Of" channel for all to admire!
